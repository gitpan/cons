Changes introduced in Cons 1.1
------------------------------

Change 2412 on 11/12/1996 by rns@rns-me

	Updates to documentation and ancillary files
	(MANIFEST, README, COPYRIGHT) for release 1.1. Added
	documentation for Ignore, FilePath, and DirPath, and
	added command summaries for all directly executable
	commands. Updated cons version number.

Change 2322 on 11/07/1996 by rns@rns-me
 
	Fix two bugs: bug in build::multiple (reversed parameters!) and
	a bug or misfeature in that no dependencies past the first ignored
	directory on PATH were being considered. Now it ignores these dependencies
	for the purposes of computing a signature, but scans the PATH until
	the dependency is found.
 
Change 1405 on 09/20/1996 by rns@rns-me
 
	Sort files in each directory before building
 
Change 735 on 07/29/1996 by rns@rns-me
 
	Don't close stdin gratuitously. This way cons can
	run interactive things.
 
Change 732 on 07/29/1996 by rns@rns-me
 
	Allow shell comment commands. If you set RANLIB to ":",
	then it won't do a ranlib anymore...
 
Change 726 on 07/26/1996 by rns@rns-me
 
	Fix file copy to preserve mtime and mode. This means
	that installs into an abs path like /usr/local will 
	work correctly (preserve x bit, for example).
 
Change 725 on 07/26/1996 by rns@rns-me
 
	Add -V which exits (-v still continues processing)
 
Change 724 on 07/26/1996 by rns@rns-me
 
	Add FilePath and DirPath commands.
 
Change 722 on 07/26/1996 by rns@rns-me
 
	Handle /, /foo correctly. Report on "." correctly.
	Simplified ->{'...'} references to new form ->{...}.
 
Change 696 on 07/24/1996 by rns@rns-me
 
	Catch SIGPIPE. If you redirect cons output to a pipeline,
	e.g. tee, then cons was being killed by the PIPE signal,
	rather than the INT, and hence was not cleaning up correctly.
