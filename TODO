NT extensions
	Greg Spencer 5 Jun 2000

Collect all output prints to a common routine and provide an interface
for customizing output.

Don't "die" immediately on errors (e.g. building a file two different
ways); finish parsing the file to catch as many errors as possible and
then die before buliding anything.

Calling the Objects method with a null list:
	$sources = qw( );
	$env->Objects($sources);
generates errors:
	cons.pl: error in file "libs\random\conscript" (don't know how to construct
	libs\random\.obj from libs\random\.)
	cons.pl: script errors encountered: construction aborted
Check other methods for the same problem.
Bug reported by Allan Stokes.
