Cons is a Perl-based make replacement.  It is not compatible with make,
but has a number of powerful capabilities not found in other software
construction systems, including make.

This package contains a development release of Cons and its documentation.
Development releases are intended for advanced features and quick delivery
of bug fixes.  If you are looking for the latest stable release, look
for an even-digit minor version number (2.0.x, 2.2.x, etc.).

A related package (cons-test) contains a portable test suite for Cons,
plus a wrapper script and supporting modules for executing the tests.
You do not need this other package to use Cons.

You will need Perl 5.002 or better and the Perl Digest::MD5 module,
available from CPAN.

Cons is known to work on a variety of platforms: it's in production
use on versions of FreeBSD, Linux, SunOS, Solaris, HPUX, AIX, IRIX and
Windows NT.

Documentation is supplied in POD format (thanks to Ulrich Pfeifer).
