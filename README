Cons is a Perl-based make replacement.  It is not compatible with make,
but has a number of powerful capabilities not found in other software
construction systems, including make.

This package contains a stable release of Cons and its documentation.
Cons is also available in development releases, intended for advanced
features and quick delivery of bug fixes.  Development releases of Cons
have odd-digit minor version numbers (2.1.x, 2.3.x, etc.).

A related package (cons-test) contains a portable test suite for Cons,
plus a wrapper script and supporting modules for executing the tests.
You do not need this other package to use Cons.

You will need Perl 5.002 or better and the Perl MD5 Extension
(MD5-1.6.tar.gz or greater), available from CPAN.

Cons is known to work on a variety of platforms: it's in production
use on versions of FreeBSD, Linux, SunOS, Solaris, HPUX, AIX, IRIX and
Windows NT.

Documentation is supplied in POD format (thanks to Ulrich Pfeifer).
