Win-NT users can execute the cons program in 2 ways:

       1. Rename it to cons.pl and associate the .pl suffix with perl so
          that Windows will always execute the program inside perl.
       2. Run cons.bat.  Make sure that perl is in your
	  path when use do this.

Users may generate various types of documentation with the pod file using
the pod2* utilities available with the perl distribution. Alternately, users 
can use the man page cons.1 supplied with this distribution and move it to a 
location in your manpath (e.g. /usr/local/man/man1) and use the UNIX man
command (man cons) to view cons documentation.
